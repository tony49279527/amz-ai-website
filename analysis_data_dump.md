- [5★] Friends, family and most importantly, my cat all love it!: It's really cute and my family and friends have complemented the fountain when they see it. Even though it's plastic, it stays pretty clean thanks to the way it's built. The way it works is that the filter goes underneath the internal green surface under the flower so any water that goes back into the bucket is cat hair and food free. This keeps the motor running smoothly since there is no worry about food/cat hair clogging it up. It does still need to be cleaned periodically though since the usual slime that builds up in any bowl or fountain is still apparent. I've noticed that after a two or so weeks, there appears to be some sort of foam that builds up in the little pool that exists on the side (where the water goes back down). Rinsing off the filter works well enough to remedy that for another few weeks. I only change the filter once it gets to the point where the rate of the water draining is so slow that you can see the water building up to the emergency drain line even though the fountain isn't that full. My cat loves this fountain and drinks from it all the time. You can choose to use just the flat surface so water does a soft flow over the surface being draining back down, making it so a little bubbler occurs that they can drink from, or with the flower, it makes 5 little streams of falling water. The noise level depends on where you put it. I have it in the corner and on tile floor so the noise is a bit louder but not to an annoying degree. It's more of a muted buzzing sound. Out of the corner and on a surface that isn't tile, it's extremely quiet. The water level also determines the loudness of the motor - the less water, the louder it is for obvious reasons. The reason I had bought this fountain was because I noticed my cat was barely drinking any water. At first she was little afraid of it but was also super intrigued and did the usual sniff, back off, sniff, lick, back off dance. After a few minutes she started drinking greedily from it and continues to do so (yay!). I have had other fountains before but I chose this one over other fountains because it was easy to clean and because it promised that it would keep out anything that wasn't water from the pool which meant the water she drank was always guaranteed to be clean and the motor wouldn't clog. This I promise is completely true, as long as you use a filter. The only negative is the filters are a little pricey and third-party filters (like the one I'm currently using) aren't as high quality. The third-party one I bought has it so Instead of the yellow or black area filling up the entire quarter of the circle, it's more like a little square piece that's within that quarter, held together by the plastic underneath and the white filter material on the top.
- [5★] Both Beau (older female kitty) and Aticus (male kitten) love drinking from the spouts of the other fountains I ...: When I first saw this water fountain I immediately wanted it! My older cat (5-years-old) usually breaks the fountains I buy for her. By break I mean she loves water so much that she will drinks consistently throughout the day and more so during the night which makes the water level so low that the motor eventually burns out. Even though I was constantly filling the water up to the appropriate level she still managed to burn every motor of every fountain I have ever bought for her. Then I brought a kitten into our family (he is now 9 months old) and sure enough, between the two of them, the last $100 fountain I bought they broke by burning the motor out. I was not at all turned off by the fact that this fountain is made out of plastic and I did my research before deciding to purchase it. The plastic is BPA free. Both Beau (older female kitty) and Aticus (male kitten) love drinking from the spouts of the other fountains I had so this one was perfect! I really love that the base is tall enough so that the cats are not straining their necks drinking water from down below. It is at a perfect height for both of them. Some reviewers complained that there should be an indicator that the water level is low. I do not agree. As a long time fountain user for my animals, I am constantly checking the water levels on my own daily or every other day. In my opinion, this should be done regardless of the water level being too low to check for potential debris that could clog or hurt the motor. Also, the motor makes a slightly louder noise when the water level is low and over the years I have learned to attune my ears to this sound- so much that periodically over the years I have heard the sound in the middle of the night and have gotten out of bed to refill the water. This isn't a problem with me because the fountain reaps so many benefits. Some other reviewers have also complained that the motor sound is too loud. Again, I disagree. Unless these people are sleeping on the floor right next to the fountain, it is barely noticeable. To provide an idea of what it sounds like with water at the appropriate level, it is a very dim humming sound. Not nearly enough to be bothersome. The dim sound gets a bit louder when the water level is too low. I will say that it took almost two weeks for both Beau and Aticus to finally drink out of the fountain. However, Beau being the picky kitty that she is, I knew this was going to happen as it has happened with every single water fountain. Since Aticus is the baby, he follows what she does most of the time, and so both ignored the fountain at first. Both cats are fed raw food with water and TikiCat canned food mixed in so I was not worried that they were not receiving any water. My own personal trick that worked to get them to finally notice and utilize the water fountain was simple. Whenever my husband and I leave for vacation, the cats are fed Orijen Six-Fish dry food in an automatic feeder. Before being scrutinized for feeding both dry and raw food (I know the pros and cons and know that both are digested differently), I would like to say that a vacation for us is maybe once a month and lasts between a weekend and a week at the most. Of course, we have a friend come in to refill the water and tend to other cat related care, but the reason behind the dry food is that the way in which I prepare the raw food is tedious and Beau will not eat it unless it is prepared by myself or my husband (did I say she was picky?) and Aticus will sworm in and eat both his food and hers. Therefore, it makes sense to have high quality dry food once a month for both the cats and the sitters sake. I digress. My trick was simple. Since neither of them seemed to take to the fountain, I replaced their regular raw food with dry food for one day. Since the dry food lacks in moisture, I knew eventually they would both become thirsty. I was right. I watched both of them drink from the fountain later that day and now they drink out of it all of the time. All in all, the price for the fountain was remarkably cheaper than any other fountain I had previously bought them. I clean it once a week as well as the motor (unless otherwise indicated), check the water level daily or every other day, and also bought a pack of replaceable filters which are replaced once a month. Even if the motor burns out on this one (which I am hoping it doesn't) I will purchase this same fountain as the price is great! Both kitties approve and so does mom! Great product! EDIT: 2016 SEPT 01 The past few weeks water has been pooling in the green reservoir despite me changing the filter every month and rinsing it and cleaning the entire fountain including the pump at the end of every week. Other than that, about three weeks into the purchase the top part of the plug in broke off and I had attempted to glue it back on with no luck, but since the fountain was still functional it wasn't a huge concern and I just loosely put it back in place. That being said, I came home today to find the fountain had overflowed despite it being at medium water level. I should have known this was the fountains immanent death. Anyway, I cleaned the fountain and replaced the filter as usual and went to to plug it in and nothing. I tried different outlets and still nothing- the fountain was done for. I am disappointed that after a little less than nine months it's completely broken and unusable but because the fountain is cheap compared to other fountains I ordered a new one. I hope the new one holds up.

That being said, I came home today to find the fountain had overflowed despite it being at medium water level. I should have known this was the fountains immanent death. Anyway, I cleaned the fountain and replaced the filter as usual and went to to plug it in and nothing. I tried different outlets and still nothing- the fountain was done for. I am disappointed that after a little less than nine months it's completely broken and unusable but because the fountain is cheap compared to other fountains I ordered a new one. I hope the new one holds up.
- [5★] Friends, family and most importantly, my cat all love it!: It's really cute and my family and friends have complemented the fountain when they see it. Even though it's plastic, it stays pretty clean thanks to the way it's built. The way it works is that the filter goes underneath the internal green surface under the flower so any water that goes back into the bucket is cat hair and food free. This keeps the motor running smoothly since there is no worry about food/cat hair clogging it up. It does still need to be cleaned periodically though since the usual slime that builds up in any bowl or fountain is still apparent. I've noticed that after a two or so weeks, there appears to be some sort of foam that builds up in the little pool that exists on the side (where the water goes back down). Rinsing off the filter works well enough to remedy that for another few weeks. I only change the filter once it gets to the point where the rate of the water draining is so slow that you can see the water building up to the emergency drain line even though the fountain isn't that full. My cat loves this fountain and drinks from it all the time. You can choose to use just the flat surface so water does a soft flow over the surface being draining back down, making it so a little bubbler occurs that they can drink from, or with the flower, it makes 5 little streams of falling water. The noise level depends on where you put it. I have it in the corner and on tile floor so the noise is a bit louder but not to an annoying degree. It's more of a muted buzzing sound. Out of the corner and on a surface that isn't tile, it's extremely quiet. The water level also determines the loudness of the motor - the less water, the louder it is for obvious reasons. The reason I had bought this fountain was because I noticed my cat was barely drinking any water. At first she was little afraid of it but was also super intrigued and did the usual sniff, back off, sniff, lick, back off dance. After a few minutes she started drinking greedily from it and continues to do so (yay!). I have had other fountains before but I chose this one over other fountains because it was easy to clean and because it promised that it would keep out anything that wasn't water from the pool which meant the water she drank was always guaranteed to be clean and the motor wouldn't clog. This I promise is completely true, as long as you use a filter. The only negative is the filters are a little pricey and third-party filters (like the one I'm currently using) aren't as high quality. The third-party one I bought has it so Instead of the yellow or black area filling up the entire quarter of the circle, it's more like a little square piece that's within that quarter, held together by the plastic underneath and the white filter material on the top.
- [5★] Both Beau (older female kitty) and Aticus (male kitten) love drinking from the spouts of the other fountains I ...: When I first saw this water fountain I immediately wanted it! My older cat (5-years-old) usually breaks the fountains I buy for her. By break I mean she loves water so much that she will drinks consistently throughout the day and more so during the night which makes the water level so low that the motor eventually burns out. Even though I was constantly filling the water up to the appropriate level she still managed to burn every motor of every fountain I have ever bought for her. Then I brought a kitten into our family (he is now 9 months old) and sure enough, between the two of them, the last $100 fountain I bought they broke by burning the motor out. I was not at all turned off by the fact that this fountain is made out of plastic and I did my research before deciding to purchase it. The plastic is BPA free. Both Beau (older female kitty) and Aticus (male kitten) love drinking from the spouts of the other fountains I had so this one was perfect! I really love that the base is tall enough so that the cats are not straining their necks drinking water from down below. It is at a perfect height for both of them. Some reviewers complained that there should be an indicator that the water level is low. I do not agree. As a long time fountain user for my animals, I am constantly checking the water levels on my own daily or every other day. In my opinion, this should be done regardless of the water level being too low to check for potential debris that could clog or hurt the motor. Also, the motor makes a slightly louder noise when the water level is low and over the years I have learned to attune my ears to this sound- so much that periodically over the years I have heard the sound in the middle of the night and have gotten out of bed to refill the water. This isn't a problem with me because the fountain reaps so many benefits. Some other reviewers have also complained that the motor sound is too loud. Again, I disagree. Unless these people are sleeping on the floor right next to the fountain, it is barely noticeable. To provide an idea of what it sounds like with water at the appropriate level, it is a very dim humming sound. Not nearly enough to be bothersome. The dim sound gets a bit louder when the water level is too low. I will say that it took almost two weeks for both Beau and Aticus to finally drink out of the fountain. However, Beau being the picky kitty that she is, I knew this was going to happen as it has happened with every single water fountain. Since Aticus is the baby, he follows what she does most of the time, and so both ignored the fountain at first. Both cats are fed raw food with water and TikiCat canned food mixed in so I was not worried that they were not receiving any water. My own personal trick that worked to get them to finally notice and utilize the water fountain was simple. Whenever my husband and I leave for vacation, the cats are fed Orijen Six-Fish dry food in an automatic feeder. Before being scrutinized for feeding both dry and raw food (I know the pros and cons and know that both are digested differently), I would like to say that a vacation for us is maybe once a month and lasts between a weekend and a week at the most. Of course, we have a friend come in to refill the water and tend to other cat related care, but the reason behind the dry food is that the way in which I prepare the raw food is tedious and Beau will not eat it unless it is prepared by myself or my husband (did I say she was picky?) and Aticus will sworm in and eat both his food and hers. Therefore, it makes sense to have high quality dry food once a month for both the cats and the sitters sake. I digress. My trick was simple. Since neither of them seemed to take to the fountain, I replaced their regular raw food with dry food for one day. Since the dry food lacks in moisture, I knew eventually they would both become thirsty. I was right. I watched both of them drink from the fountain later that day and now they drink out of it all of the time. All in all, the price for the fountain was remarkably cheaper than any other fountain I had previously bought them. I clean it once a week as well as the motor (unless otherwise indicated), check the water level daily or every other day, and also bought a pack of replaceable filters which are replaced once a month. Even if the motor burns out on this one (which I am hoping it doesn't) I will purchase this same fountain as the price is great! Both kitties approve and so does mom! Great product!
