### 5.4 Customer Q&A Expansion

**Practical Q&A Sample:**

| Question                                         | Answer                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| How long is the power cord attached to the tool? | The tool does not supply its own full-length cord—use a standard outdoor-rated extension cord of adequate length for your property, secured by the integrated cord retention system for safety. |
| Can I use generic/aftermarket line spools?       | Yes, most standard 0.065"–0.080" trimmer lines are compatible; check your product manual for fitment and load instructions. Bulk spools may require manual winding. |
| Is this suitable for edging thick, established sod? | Yes, the 6.5A motor can handle most standard residential edge jobs; however, for extremely dense/thick sod or invasive growth, multiple slower passes may be required. |
| How difficult is assembly for first-time users?     | Assembly requires no tools beyond a Phillips screwdriver. Step-by-step pictorial guide is included, and a full assembly video is available online. Most users complete setup in under 10 minutes.  |
| Is it safe for seniors or users with arthritis?      | Yes; ergonomic grips and adjustable handle/height make it accessible to users of varying strength and mobility. Light weight minimizes fatigue, and easy-to-activate controls reduce strain. |
| Can I use it for trenching to bury cable lines?      | It can shallow-trench soft soil (up to 1–1.5"), but for deeper or harder ground, a specialized edger or trencher is recommended. |
| Is the warranty international?                       | The standard 2-Year Limited Warranty applies in the US, UK, and most EU markets. Please check local policy for coverage details. |
| What is the noise level compared to gas models?      | Significantly lower—typical operation under 80 dB, suitable for most municipal quiet hours and denser neighborhoods. |
