### 2.2 Core Competitor Analysis

| Competitor | Type | Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DeWalt Kit** | Mechanical Kit | Includes sockets + breaker bar. | Expensive ($110+). Sockets may be too shallow. |
| **GearWrench** | Digital | Cool tech features, angle mode. | **Fragile**. Screens crack, batteries die. |
| **YIYEI / SUZUME** | Budget Set | 3-wrench set for price of 1. | Unknown reliability. Max torque often lower (150 ft-lb). |
| **ACDelco** | Digital Adapter | Cheap digital upgrade. | Bulky, adds height, batteries required. |

### 2.3 Competitive Strategy

**Key Insight:** Digital wrenches are "fragile toys"; Craftsman is a "Time-tested Tool". Win on **Reliability**.

**Operational Advice:**
1.  **"Tire Ready":** Position as the *essential* tool for wheel swaps.
2.  **Anti-Digital Campaign:** "No Batteries. No Screens. Just Torque."
3.  **Bundle:** Sell with 1/2" Impact Socket Set (essential companion).
4.  **Educate:** "Why you need 1/2 inch" (For wheels/Suspension) vs "3/8 inch" (For engine/spark plugs).
