## IV. Listing Optimization Plan

### 4.1 Title Optimization

**English Version:**
> Terunsoul 4K+4K Dual Dash Cam Front and Rear - True UHD 8MP Car Camera with 5.8GHz WiFi & GPS, Free 128GB Card, Super Night Vision, WDR, 24H Parking Mode, Support 512GB Max (Capacitor Power)

**Logic:**

*   **USP:** "Free 128GB Card", "True UHD".

### 4.2 Bullet Points Optimization

*   **[TRUE DUAL 4K UHD RECORDING]** Unlike competitors that pair 4K front with 1080p rear, Terunsoul records cinema-quality 3840x2160P @ 30fps on **BOTH** cameras. Capture license plates clearly from tailgaters or rear-end collisions, ensuring you have indisputable evidence from every angle.
*   **[BLAZING FAST 5.8GHZ WIFI & APP]** Stop waiting minutes for videos to download. Our upgraded 5.8GHz WiFi module transfers footage 4x faster than standard 2.4GHz connections. Instantly view, download, and share accident clips to police or insurance via the intuitive App without removing the SD card.
*   **[SUPER STARLIGHT NIGHT VISION]** Equipped with advanced WDR (Wide Dynamic Range) and F1.5 (Front) / F1.8 (Rear) large apertures. The camera automatically balances light in low-light or high-contrast scenes, reducing headlight glare to capture sharp details even on dark country roads.
*   **[PRE-INSTALLED 128GB CARD & GPS]** Ready to use out of the box. We include a high-endurance 128GB MicroSD card (saves you ~$20). Built-in GPS accurately records your driving route and speed, providing vital location data for insurance claims.
*   **[24H PARKING GUARDIAN]** Sleep soundly while your car is parked. With an optional Hardwire Kit (sold separately), the camera enters Time-Lapse Parking Mode, continuously monitoring for impacts or movement. The G-Sensor automatically locks footage if a collision is detected.
