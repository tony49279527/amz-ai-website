## III. Return Report Analysis

**Status:** NO_RETURN_REPORT (Inferred Analysis)

### 3.1 Estimated Return Reasons
1.  **Expectations Not Met (30-35%):** Users expect "magic instant fix" for extremely old/damaged clothes.
2.  **Fabric Damage (20-25%):** User error (pressing too hard, uneven surface) causing holes.
3.  **Battery Issues (15-20%):** Defective units or dissatisfaction with runtime on high speed.
4.  **Noise (10-12%):** Sensitive users finding it too loud.

### 3.2 Deep Dive: "Expectations Not Met"
*   **Root Cause:** Marketing videos often show light pilling removal which is instant. Heavy pilling requires multiple passes (patience), leading to frustration ("It took 2 hours").
*   **Solution:** Education. Show "Before/After" with realistic time expectations for heavy duty jobs.
